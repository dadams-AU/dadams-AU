# **About Me**
> _"I teach because I like it. The students are eager and full of ideas. We learn together..."_

I'm an educator, passionate about **public policy**, **public administration**, and the rapidly evolving field of **collaborative governance**. My research is focused on the intriguing intersection where public policy crosses paths with networks of actors and community involvement, particularly in the sphere of **water policy**. 

Analyzing the outcomes of shared governance, I believe in the power of working together — the real, tangible ways it shapes our world.

### **The Things That Matter**
Beyond my professional life, **family** takes precedence. The shared time with my children and pets, whether indoors or outdoors, is invaluable. Volunteering is another passion of mine, as it fosters a sense of purpose and community.

### **A Taste of Culture**
Being a resident of Southern California, I relish the area's cultural diversity — its people, landscapes, and foods. Despite its contrast to my original home, I've grown fond of it. I still, however, carry a part of my Southern heritage with me, manifesting in the food I cook and the authors I read.
