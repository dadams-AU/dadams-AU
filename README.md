## Hi, I’m David Adams 👋

I’m an **Associate Professor of Public Administration** working at the intersection of **collaborative governance**, **environmental policy**, and **data-driven public management**. I’m currently working a book on **collaboration** and institutional design in natural resource governance. 🌿💧

Right now, I’m building out a **hypothesis model of collaboration**, analyzing large datasets on **California Climate Investments** and **oil and gas inspections** in **Texas, Pennsylvania, and Colorado**, and using spatial data to explore patterns in **GHG reduction, equity, and regulatory oversight**.

### 🛠️ **Tools & Tech I’m Using**  
- **PostgreSQL + PostGIS** for spatial analysis  
- **Python**, **R**, and **Rust** for data modeling & automation  
- Exploring **efficient web-based visualizations** for public policy  

### 🤝 **Collaborating On**
