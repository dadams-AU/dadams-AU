# **About Me**
> _"I teach because I like it. The students are eager and full of ideas. We learn together..."_

You can find my organization's page [@CSUF-MPA](https://github.com/CSUF-MPA) with some resources related to my work.

I'm a social scientist and educator, passionate about **public policy**, **public administration**, and the rapidly evolving field of **collaborative governance**. My research is focused on the intriguing intersection where public policy crosses paths with networks of actors and community involvement, particularly in the sphere of **water policy**. 

Analyzing the outcomes of shared governance, I believe in the power of working together — the real, tangible ways it shapes our world.
