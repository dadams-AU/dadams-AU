# Hi, I’m dadams! 👋

I'm a social scientist and associate professor of public administration. 🎓 I'm interested in adaptive institutions and structures for natural resource governance, particularly water governance and policy. 💧 For a number of years, I've studied stakeholder engagement in collaborative institutions and the impact on water quality.

My interests are moving to the integration of blockchain, IoT, and open-source technology, which has the potential to revolutionize water resource governance. 🌐 By enhancing transparency, collaboration, efficiency, adaptability, and decentralization, these technologies align well with what I've learned about adaptive management and polycentric governance.
